## Translation of this branch to `old`, and the `nuxt` branch to `mango`

This happened due to the fact that Nuxt has a good SSR for SEO development

But you can also run this version

### ENV File
```ts
PORT=<number> // default - 3000
VITE_API_URL=<string>
```

### Run dev
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Build
```
npm run build
```

### Prod

npm run preview
```

###### All the best to you :O
